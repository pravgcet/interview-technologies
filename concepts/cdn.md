# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver web content, such as images, videos, scripts, and other assets, to users based on their geographic location. The primary goal of a CDN is to improve the speed, reliability, and security of content delivery.

## Key Responsibilities of a CDN:

1. **Content Caching:** Stores copies of static content closer to users to reduce latency.
2. **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
3. **Latency Reduction:** Reduces the time it takes for content to travel from the server to the user.
4. **DDoS Protection:** Mitigates Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by distributing traffic across the network.
5. **Failover and Redundancy:** Ensures content delivery even if some servers go down.

## Examples of CDNs:

1. **Cloudflare:**
   - Provides DDoS protection, DNS services, and caching to speed up website performance.
2. **Akamai:**
   - One of the oldest and largest CDNs, widely used for delivering large-scale web content and streaming.
3. **Amazon CloudFront:**
   - Integrates with AWS services to provide scalable content delivery.
4. **Fastly:**
   - Focuses on real-time caching and edge computing.
5. **Google Cloud CDN:**
   - Leverages Google's global infrastructure to serve content quickly and securely.
6. **Microsoft Azure CDN:**
   - Provides global content delivery solutions integrated with Azure services.
