# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** is a design pattern that separates the operations that modify data (commands) from the operations that read data (queries). This separation helps optimize performance, scalability, and maintainability, especially in complex systems.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Commands:**

   - Responsible for performing operations that modify data (e.g., Create, Update, Delete).
   - Example: Placing an order, updating user information.

2. **Queries:**

   - Responsible for retrieving data without making any modifications.
   - Example: Fetching order details, listing user profiles.

3. **Event Sourcing (Optional):**
   - Often used with CQRS to store changes as a sequence of events.

## Advantages:

- **Scalability:** Separate read and write models allow independent scaling.
- **Performance Optimization:** Queries can be optimized with different data models.
- **Simplified Codebase:** Clear separation of concerns reduces code complexity.
- **Flexibility:** Allows use of different databases for read and write operations.

## Disadvantages:

- **Increased Complexity:** Additional layers require more infrastructure.
- **Data Synchronization:** Ensuring consistency between command and query models can be challenging.
- **Eventual Consistency:** In distributed systems, queries might not reflect the latest changes instantly.

## Example Use Cases:

- **E-commerce:** Separate systems for order processing and order tracking.
- **Banking Systems:** Different workflows for handling transactions and displaying account balances.
- **Microservices:** Each microservice handles either commands or queries, simplifying responsibilities.
