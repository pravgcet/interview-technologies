# API Gateway

An **API Gateway** is a server that acts as an entry point for all client requests to a backend system, especially in a microservices architecture. It handles the communication between clients and multiple services, providing a single access point for managing APIs.

## Key Responsibilities of an API Gateway:

### Request Routing:

- Directs incoming client requests to the appropriate backend service.
- Supports load balancing to distribute requests across multiple instances.

### Authentication and Authorization:

- Verifies the identity of the client using authentication methods (e.g., API keys, OAuth, JWT).
- Ensures only authorized users can access specific services.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling:

- Controls the number of requests a client can make in a given period.
- Prevents abuse and protects backend services from being overwhelmed.

### Monitoring and Analytics:

- Tracks and logs requests and responses for performance monitoring.
- Provides insights into API usage patterns and potential failures.

### Request/Response Transformation:

- Modifies requests or responses (e.g., converting data formats, adding headers) to ensure compatibility between clients and services.

### Service Discovery:

- Integrates with service discovery mechanisms to dynamically route requests as services scale or change.

### Security Enforcement:

- Protects backend services from threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

- Manages CORS policies to control which domains can access APIs.

### Circuit Breaking and Fault Tolerance:

- Detects failures in backend services and prevents repeated failures by breaking the circuit temporarily, offering fallback responses if needed.

### Aggregation (Request Composition):

- Combines multiple service responses into a single response, reducing the number of client requests.

## Examples of API Gateways:

### 1. **AWS API Gateway:**

- A fully managed service that makes it easy to create, deploy, and manage APIs.
- Integrates seamlessly with AWS Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.

### 2. **Kong:**

- Open-source API Gateway built on NGINX.
- Supports plugins for authentication, rate limiting, logging, and more.

### 3. **Apigee (by Google):**

- Provides tools for full lifecycle API management.
- Offers advanced analytics, developer portal, and security features.

### 4. **Envoy:**

- High-performance proxy developed by Lyft.
- Commonly used as a sidecar in service mesh architectures.

### 5. **Zuul (by Netflix):**

- Built to handle Netflix's large-scale microservices architecture.
- Provides dynamic routing, rate limiting, and security.
